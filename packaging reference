Making packaging form shell script

-> This is being done in debian9
-> Needed tools for packaging dh_make,debuild and to install type in terminal
-> apt install dh-make devscripts
-> cat >>~/.bashrc<<EOF
-> DEBEMAIL=”YOUR MAIL OR ORGANIZATION MAIL”
-> DEBFULLNAME=”YOUR NAME OR ORGANIZATION NAME”
-> export DEBEMAIL DEBFULLNAME
-> EOF
-> run ~/.bashrc only once

-> create a simple shell script
-> write “mkdir /home/sample\ folder” in create(it is a file) 
-> mkdir package-version-0.0
-> cd package-version-0.0
-> dh_make --indep --createorig
-> gedit debian/install
-> hello.sh /usr/bin
-> again run
-> dh_make --indep --createorig
-> a tar.gz file while come as output which will be located at the folder above this. 
-> debuild  -uc -us
-> after this some files are formed in the folder above this
